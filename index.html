Our school canteen is very well equipped. One can buy almost every kind of snack there, like samosas, chips, sandwiches, sweet, cakes etc. They are prepared in very hygienic surroundings by our school cook, and tables to sit on and eat, and ovens to keep the food warm. There is also a soda fountain which is Very popular among the older students.

                    Won First in Inter School Debate Competition</h5>
                <p>Inter-school competitions are held on various topics, throughout the year involving several schools. This is a very healthy thing as a student is assessed, not only within the school, but is compared with the students of all the other schools too. These competitions give the younger generation a boost and raise their confidence while progressively developing a positive attitude towards competitions.</p>

                <p>All work and no play make Jack a dull boy‚Äù. Games and sports are an integral part of education. They assist in the overall development of a child. A healthy mind resides in a healthy body, sports and games keep a student physically healthy and fit. Moreover, merely bookish knowledge will produce only bookworms. Hence, sports have become an essential part of the curriculum of schools everywhere.</p>

                <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Safely managed water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services are an essential part of preventing and protecting human health during infectious disease outbreaks, including the current COVID-19 pandemic. One of the most cost-effective strategies for increasing pandemic preparedness, especially in resource-constrained settings, is investing in core public health infrastructure, including water and sanitation systems. Good WASH and waste management practices, that are consistently applied, serve as barriers to human-to-human transmission of the COVID-19 virus in homes, communities, health care facilities, schools, and other public spaces. </p>
